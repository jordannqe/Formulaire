<h1>Elsa CUVELIER <br /><br />
interview collected on  22/11/16</h1>

<h2>Motivation to come in our DUT?</h2> 
<p> My motivations for coming to DUT were to ensure continuity of what I had already learned through my specialty. I wanted to continue in the field 
of computing and learn more about the different programming languages ​​that exist and perfect myself in what I already knew. </p>
<h3 class="titreListe">Previous course</h3>
<ul class="cursus">
<li> 2013-2014 Baccalauréat Science and Technology of Industry and Sustainable Development specialty Information and digital systems </li> 

<li>2014-2016 Computer Science in Lens </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="titreListe">Continuing Studies</h3>
<ul class="cursus"> 
<li>2016-2019 IG2I in Lens Learning at CGI </li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills developed at ITU?</h2>
<p>During my 2 years I developed skills in many fields of computer science such as programming in several languages ​​but also project management and its design phases.
 The communication is also a dominant during these 2 years because it prepares us to know to manage situations of companies (maintenance, meeting, telephone call, ...) but 
 also the situations of the life of every day. Thanks to the many projects we study all the phases of the project and we prepare for the period of internship in company.</p>

<h2>If I were suppose to start my studies again, I would choose the Lens IUT because ...</h2><p> I was able to perfect myself in what I liked, the computer
 curriculum allows To discover new things and is based only on computers unlike an engineering school. I recommend switching to DUT Informatique if you are passionate about this
 area, want to learn more and make it your trade later.</p>
<h2>What impact has my DUT had on my future career?</h2>
<p>
The DUT Informatique allowed me to open the doors of learning. Indeed my company of end of stage of DUT hired me in apprenticeship at the end of the internship. I chose to 
continue in engineering school to improve myself further but also to integrate into a company and increase my professional experience.</p>

<h2>What advice should be given to students or prospective students?</h2>
<p>If you are computer enthusiast or just if you like this area and want to learn more is the DUT Informatique which is the most suitable to continue its studies.
 It trains in several areas and offers wide opportunity on the future.</p>


<h2>I want to say…</h2>
<p id="merci">Thank you to Mrs Membré for helping me find my company thanks to her internship announcements.</p>
